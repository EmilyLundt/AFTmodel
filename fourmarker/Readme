This is an addition to the original archive, for an application of the AFT
approach to a data set with four markers: amyloid PET, tau PET, white matter
hyperintensity, and fractional anisotropy.

  stanfit.R:  R code to run the stan fit, on simulated data
  simdata.rds: Simulated data
  aft4.stan:  The stan program, which is called by stanfit.R

Note the final line of stanfit.R, which is save the result to disk.  The fit can
take a long while to run (over a day).  A later program will read this in to 
produce tables and graphs; usually many times as a paper is refined.
